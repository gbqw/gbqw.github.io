## Understanding DeFi Portfolio Tracking  

DeFi portfolio tracking involves aggregating and monitoring investments across decentralized protocols. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi assets are often spread across multiple blockchains and platforms, making unified oversight challenging. Effective tracking tools must:  
- Support multi-protocol integration  
- Provide real-time performance metrics  
- Offer granular insights into yield farming, staking, and liquidity pools  
- Ensure secure wallet synchronization  

AssetDash addresses these requirements while prioritizing user experience and actionable analytics.
