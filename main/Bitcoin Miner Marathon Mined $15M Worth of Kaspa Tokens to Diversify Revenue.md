## Why Kaspa? Technical Advantages for Miners

Kaspa's **GHOSTDAG protocol** represents a significant technological advancement in blockchain consensus mechanisms. Unlike Bitcoin's traditional single-chain architecture, Kaspa's PoW system allows **parallel block production**, dramatically increasing transaction throughput and miner reward opportunities. This technical innovation addresses two critical pain points for miners:

1. **Faster Transaction Finality**: Blocks are confirmed in **1 second** (vs. Bitcoin's 10-minute average)
2. **Higher Block Rewards**: Parallel mining creates more frequent reward distribution cycles

Adam Swick, Marathon's Chief Growth Officer, emphasized this strategic advantage:  
_"By mining Kaspa, we create revenue streams diversified from Bitcoin while staying aligned with our digital asset compute expertise."_  

### Comparative Mining Performance (Bitcoin vs. Kaspa)
| Metric                | Bitcoin (BTC) | Kaspa (KAS)       |
|----------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Block Time           | 10 minutes    | 1 second          |
| Current Block Reward | 3.125 BTC     | 0.25 KAS          |
| Network Difficulty   | 65.8T         | Dynamic scaling   |
| Transaction Speed    | 7 TPS         | 1,000+ TPS        |
