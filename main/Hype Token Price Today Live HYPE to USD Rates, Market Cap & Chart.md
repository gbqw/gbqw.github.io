### Social Tokenomics Explained

The HYPE ecosystem introduces a revolutionary approach to tokenomics where:
- **Inflationary Mechanisms**: Community voting determines emission rates
- **Deflationary Forces**: Burn events and buyback programs require collective consensus
- **Governance Model**: No centralized authority controls monetary policy

This experimental framework challenges traditional cryptocurrency models by placing complete control in the hands of token holders. The system's effectiveness serves as a living case study for decentralized monetary systems.
