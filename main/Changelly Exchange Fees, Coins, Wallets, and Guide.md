## Changelly's Evolution

Founded in 2013 as a spin-off from MinerGate, Changelly has undergone significant transformations. Initially a prototype, it became an independent exchange in 2014 under CEO Konstantin Gladych. A major redesign in 2016 coincided with its launch on the International Day of Human Space Flight, symbolizing its forward-thinking approach. In 2018, leadership transitioned to Ilya Bere, and the company relocated to Malta to leverage its crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Today, Changelly serves over 2 million users globally.

### Technological Advancements

Changelly's integration with top-tier exchanges ensures real-time rate comparisons. Its algorithm processes transactions in milliseconds, executing trades at optimal prices. This technology underpins its reputation for speed, with most exchanges completing within 5â€“30 minutes.

## Changelly Fees: What Users Pay

### Cost-Saving Tips
