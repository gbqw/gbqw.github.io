# Phantom Wallet Generator: Python Script for Cryptocurrency Wallet Creation  

This comprehensive guide explores a Python-based Phantom wallet generator utilizing BIP-39 mnemonics and NaCl cryptographic operations. Designed for developers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, this tool simplifies wallet creation while maintaining security standards. Below, weâ€™ll examine its features, implementation steps, and best practices for responsible usage.  

## Key Features of the Phantom Wallet Generator  

The script offers four core functionalities that streamline cryptocurrency wallet creation:  

1. **BIP-39 Mnemonic Generation**  
   Creates 24-word mnemonic phrases adhering to the BIP-39 standard, ensuring compatibility with most wallet systems.  

2. **Wallet Creation via NaCl Cryptography**  
   Uses the NaCl library for secure cryptographic operations, generating signing keys and verification keys for wallet integrity.  

3. **Address Derivation**  
   Converts public keys into Phantom-compatible wallet addresses using Base58 encoding.  

4. **Data Storage**  
   Automatically saves generated wallets in a structured `wallets.json` file with address, keys, and mnemonic phrase details.

## Technical Requirements  

Before implementation, ensure your environment meets these prerequisites:  
- Python 3.7+  
- `nacl`, `mnemonic`, `hashlib`, and `base58` libraries  

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide  

### Installation Process  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/adr1an-debug/generator-phantom-wallet.git  
   cd generator-phantom-wallet  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

### Usage Instructions  

1. **Run the Script**  
   Execute the following command to generate five wallets:  
   ```bash  
   python generate_wallets.py  
   ```  

2. **Output Format**  
   Wallet data is stored in `wallets.json` using this structure:  
   ```  
   wallet_address:public_key:private_key:mnemonic_phrase  
   ```  

### Library Installation Options  

Choose from two installation methods:  

| Method                | Command                              |  
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| **Using pip**         | `pip install nacl mnemonic base58`   |  
| **From Source**       | `pip install .` (after cloning repo) |

## Code Architecture Breakdown  

The script follows a modular structure for transparency and maintainability:  

1. **Mnemonic Generation**  
   ```python  
   def generate_mnemonic():  
       mnemo = Mnemonic("english")  
       return mnemo.generate(strength=256)  
   ```  

2. **Wallet Derivation**  
   ```python  
   def generate_wallet():  
       mnemonic = generate_mnemonic()  
       seed = Mnemonic("english").to_seed(mnemonic)  
       signing_key = nacl.signing.SigningKey(sha256(seed).digest()[:32])  
       public_key = signing_key.verify_key.encode().decode("utf-8")  
       return base58.b58encode(signing_key.verify_key.encode()).decode("utf-8"), public_key, signing_key.encode().decode("utf-8"), mnemonic  
   ```  

## Security Considerations  

While this script provides educational value, implement these security measures:  
- Run the script in isolated environments (e.g., air-gapped systems)  
- Never expose generated private keys  
- Verify library authenticity before installation  

## Frequently Asked Questions  

### Q1: Can I generate more than 5 wallets at once?  
Yes. Modify the range value in the scriptâ€™s loop (`for _ in range(5):` to `range(10):` for 10 wallets).  

### Q2: How secure are BIP-39 mnemonics?  
BIP-39 phrases offer 256-bit entropy security when properly implemented, equivalent to Bitcoinâ€™s security standard.  

### Q3: Is this script suitable for production use?  
This tool serves educational purposes. For production environments, consult blockchain security experts.
