## BTC Options Flow Analysis

### Concentration in Key Put Options

As of June 30, 2025, Derive's platform shows:
- **$54M+ open interest** in BTC put options
- Primary strike prices at **$85,000, $100,000, and $106,000**
- Expiry date concentration: **July 11, 2025**

These figures indicate traders are preparing for potential price declines following BTC's recent 7% rally from sub-$100,000 levels. The concentration in these specific strike prices suggests technical analysis-driven positioning, with $100,000 acting as both psychological and historical support/resistance level.

- **Liquidation of $100K and below puts**
- **Increased call option purchases** at $108K-$115K levels
- Strategic adjustments during US market calm before July 4th holiday

This divergence highlights differing risk appetites between decentralized and traditional crypto market participants.
