# How Much Does a Phala (PHA) Mining Machine Cost?  

Phala Network's recent success in Kusama's fourth slot auction has reignited interest in its mining ecosystem. With over 131,115 KSM tokens locked in its parachain bid, the project has secured critical infrastructure for its decentralized cloud computing platform. This milestone marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency investors seeking opportunities in the Polkadot ecosystem.  

## Kusama Slot Auction Victory and Its Implications  

On July 13th, Phala Network (Khala Network's sister project) achieved a decisive victory in Kusama's fourth parachain slot auction. The successful bid of 131,115 KSM tokens ensured immediate activation of its slot, eliminating the prolonged waiting period experienced during previous competitive rounds. This win not only validates the community's confidence in Phala's technology but also sets the stage for its mainnet launch.  

### Why Slot Auction Participation Matters  
- **Immediate Mining Activation**: Only projects with secured slots can begin token generation.  
- **Network Security**: Parachain status ensures robust security through Kusama's shared consensus mechanism.  
- **Economic Incentives**: Early participants gain higher staking rewards during the "head miner" phase.  

## PHA Mainnet Launch Timeline  

Following the auction victory, Phala Network will follow a structured deployment process:  
1. **Observation Period**: 7-day monitoring of chain stability post-slot allocation.  
2. **Incentive Distribution**: Historical rewards for contributors will be distributed within 3-7 days.  
3. **Mainnet Activation**: Based on current timelines, the PHA mainnet is expected to go live around August 3rd, 2025.  

## How to Participate in PHA Mining  

For investors looking to capitalize on this opportunity, the process involves two critical steps:  

### 1. Acquiring PHA Mining Hardware  
Mining operations require specialized hardware meeting Phala Network's technical specifications. Key considerations include:
